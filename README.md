# Pishing-Url-Classification

Phishing or Legit URLs

The code folder has 4 file, the first 3 are .ipynb files start with 01, 02 and 03 respectively. the codes are self explanatory. in 01 file the datasets are obtained from the data folder - url_original.csv and urldata.csv(can be obtained by unzipping urldata.csv.zip). at the final 03 file we save the model (model2_final.sav) which I haven't uploaded commited due to its huge file size. if you follow all the steps in the .ipymb files you will be able to crreat the model at the 03 file. the model is saved under the code folder.

Under the code folder we have the url.py which is a streamlit app code that enables the user to input the urls and predict if they are genuine of phishing urls.
The app also allows the user to enter a batch of urls stored in a file, the test.csv file under the data folder can be used as batch ubload to test multiple prediction.

Bellow are the Screenshots.
